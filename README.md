# MotherMayI #

MotherMayI is a simple ACL lib/schema using Redis.  
_Mother may who do what to whom?_

It does not keep track of users or groups, leaving that as an exercize for the user, which adds to its flexibility.
You can grant a user slug (who) an action (what) to an object (whom).

The code itself is actually pretty well documented inline, but since you're lazy, I'll document it here as well.

## Installing

    npm install mothermayi

## Running the tests

**WARNING** The tests are destructive. You'll need to edit the testconfig.json to specify a db and enable the tests before running. You should not be able to run the tests without editing this file first.

    node testall.js

## Examples ##

These examples give a "user:Username" and "group:Groupname" schema. You may use whatever schema you want for your "who slugs." This schema just allows for checking permissions on a group or username without risking collisions.

### Starting

    var MotherMayI = require('mothermayi').MotherMayI;
    //host, port, db
    var mayi = new MotherMayI('localhost', 6379, 0); //if not specified, these are the defaults

### Checking Access

    mayi.may('user:Bilbo', 'wear', 'TheOneRing', function(may) {
        if(may) {
            console.log('Bilbo may where the One Ring!');
        } else {
            console.log('Bilbo may NOT wear the One Ring');
        }
    });

### Granting Access

    mayi.grant('user:Bilbo', 'wear', 'TheOneRing', function(success) {});

### Revoking Access
    
    mayi.revoke('user:Bilbo', 'wear', 'TheOneRing', function(success) {});

### Checking Multiple User Slugs at Once

Since you might have users, groups, teams, etc, it is nice to be able to check them in one command and get a `true` back if any are true.

    mayi.mayThey(['user:Gandalf', 'group:'Wizards'], 'wear', 'TheOneRing', function(may) {
        if(may) {
            console.log('Either Gandalf or the Wizards may wear the One Ring.');
        } else {
            console.log('Neither Gandalf nor the Wizards may wear the One Ring.');
        }
    });

### Closing

    mayi.disconnect();
